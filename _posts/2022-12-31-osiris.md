# Introduction

The three previous networks discussed in this blog (Freenet, i2p and tor) were relatively well known compared to this one, this network is considered part of the deepweb as it is not indexed by normal search engines, it is considered an intranet due to its low number of users.

## Basic concepts

## p2p

A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network in which each node or device can act as a client or server and can communicate directly with other nodes without the need for a central server. This means that each node on the network can share and access resources such as files, printers and bandwidth directly with other nodes on the network, rather than relying on a central server to handle these tasks.

## What was Osiris?

Osiris is a decentralized network that belongs to the deep web, which is a part of the Internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires special software to access. Like other deep web networks such as Freenet and I2P, Osiris was primarily used to enable anonymous communication and online privacy.

The Osiris browser could be downloaded from its official website (http://www.osiris-sps.org/) which is no longer available and may never be available again. This software was available for Windows and Linux.

## What is Osiris?

Today this network is in disuse, at the time it was not very popular, it is like i2p today, a very interesting network with potential but with lack of support from the community, this type of network, being so small, complex and secure has been used mainly for illegal things as it is a network that not many people know how to use and of which very little is known.

Currently you can only access if you have the osiris browser, this software is no longer on the internet and any copy of this program may contain malware, osiris nodes are still active but the software is not accessible, this makes it a very private network that comes to be considered intranet.

## Advantages and disadvantages

One of the main advantages of Osiris is that it provides greater privacy and anonymity online as it is not indexed by search engines. It can also be useful for those who wish to avoid surveillance or censorship on the Internet as this network is immune to denial of service since it is shared via p2p.

However, there are also disadvantages associated with Osiris and other deep web networks. Some of these include the fact that it can be difficult to use for users unfamiliar with the software and that it can be used for illegal or inappropriate activities.

## How it can be accessed

As discussed above you can only access it with the Osiris software which is no longer public, but if you have the software you can access it in a very similar way to Freenet, you start the Osiris console and access the pages you have, currently there are no directories with links to this network, if you don't have it you can't access it as the only way you could find new web portals was through Isis Gateway (www.osiris-sps.org/isis/) which was on the official Osiris website.

You can only access domains you are subscribed to, subscriptions were done via the Osiris console.

## Conclusion

Although this network is inactive it deserves a post because in its time it was an important network for those who knew it and it can not be forgotten, if you search the internet you will find very little information about this network. You can find more information in [WikiPedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_(Serverless_Portal_System)) and Chema Alonso's blog ([ElLadoDelmal](https://www.elladodelmal.com/2013/11/osiris-sps-portales-en-la-deep-web-sin.html))

Finally I will leave a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2my4RFq96x4) showing how Osiris was accessed, minute 13:28.
