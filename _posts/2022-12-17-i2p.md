## Basic concepts
 
## p2p

A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network in which each node or device can act as a client or server and can communicate directly with other nodes without the need for a central server. This means that each node on the network can share and access resources such as files, printers and bandwidth directly with other nodes on the network, rather than relying on a central server to handle these tasks.

One of the main advantages of P2P networks is that they do not rely on a central server, which makes them more resistant to failures and censorship. In addition, P2P networks can be more efficient than other networks because resources are shared directly between nodes rather than relying on a central server to manage and distribute resources.

Another advantage of P2P networks is that they can be more scalable than other networks, as there is no single point of failure or bottleneck in the network. Instead of relying on a central server, the network relies on each node contributing resources and bandwidth. This means that as more nodes are added to the network, the network's capacity to handle traffic increases.

However, P2P networks also have some disadvantages. One is that they can be less secure than other networks, since there is no central server that can be responsible for the security of the network. In addition, P2P networks can be more difficult to configure and maintain, as each node in the network must be individually configured and updated.

Despite these disadvantages, P2P networks have been used successfully in a wide variety of applications, such as file sharing, real-time communication and online gaming. They have also been used in the development of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which relies on a P2P network to validate and record transactions.

## i2p

The i2p (Interactive Internet Protocol) network is a private, decentralized and anonymous network that allows its users to send and receive data securely and anonymously. This network is based on the Internet Protocol, but uses encryption and traffic forwarding techniques to ensure the privacy and security of its users.

The i2p network was developed in 2003 as an open source project and has been widely used by those seeking to protect their online privacy and avoid mass surveillance. Although the i2p network is less well known than other private networks such as [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/), it has proven to be a secure and reliable option for those seeking to protect their online privacy.

i2p is similar to Torrent as they both use the p2p protocol, in the case of i2p it is used in a more secure way as the connection is encrypted for each node it passes through, in the following image you can see how content is shared using the p2p protocol.

## Uses and advantages of i2p

One of the main advantages of the i2p network is that it does not use exit nodes, which means that data traffic does not pass through a centralized point that could be intercepted or monitored. Instead, data traffic is rerouted through a series of nodes in the network, which makes it very difficult to track the activity of a specific user.

In addition, the i2p network uses end-to-end encryption techniques to protect the privacy of its users. This means that only the sender and recipient of a message can read the contents of the message, even if the message is intercepted by a third party during its transmission over the network.

The i2p network is also decentralized, meaning that it does not rely on a single server or control center. Instead, the network relies on a network of volunteer nodes that contribute bandwidth and processing resources to keep the network running. This makes the network highly resistant to attacks and censorship, as there is no single point that can be blocked or shut down.

The i2p network can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including sending messages and exchanging files privately and securely. It can also be used to access websites and online services anonymously, thus protecting users' privacy while surfing the Internet.

In addition, the i2p network has been used by human rights organizations and journalists to protect themselves.

## i2p domains

i2p domains are addresses that are used to access web sites and services on the i2p network. Unlike traditional Internet domains, which use the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Domain Name System (DNS) to convert domain names into IP addresses, i2p domains use the i2p protocol and a proprietary domain name system to convert domain names into i2p addresses.

The i2p domains are composed of two parts: a domain name part and a destination identifier part. The domain name part is similar to traditional domain names, and is used to identify a specific web site or service in the i2p network. The destination identifier part is a unique string of characters that is used to identify a specific location on the i2p network.

For example, an i2p domain might have the following structure: "domainname.i2p/targetidentifier". The domain name "domainname.i2p" is used to identify a specific website or service, while the destination identifier "destinationidentifier" is used to identify the exact location of that site or service in the i2p network.

Destinations, as in the tor network, are made up of base64 or base32 strings to which the extension is added, for example "http://udhdrtrcetjm5sxzskjyr5ztpeszydbh4dpl3pl4utgqqw2v4jna.b32.i2p", in this case base32 is used.

Shorteners are short names that you can give to these destinations, you can not access a shortener if it does not point to a destination, it is like if you want to call a phone number but you only have the contact name, in this case the contact name is the shortener that is only used for a more comfortable navigation.

## How to access the i2p network?

To access the i2p network you need the i2p console, it allows you to manipulate the configuration of the i2p router, this console is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux (BSD, Solaris), Ubuntu and some other platforms, you can download the installer from the [i2p official website](https://geti2p.net/), the installation is easy and guided, so I will not explain how to install it.
