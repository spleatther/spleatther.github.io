# Introduction

Hyperboria is a secure and private communication network that is used to send messages and share information securely with trusted individuals. It is more secure and resistant to cyber attacks and surveillance, and is also less prone to have issues or outages due to its decentralized design. However, it is less user-friendly and has less available content than the Internet. To connect to Hyperboria, you need to download and set up special software and connect to a network node.

# Basic Concepts

## p2p

A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network where each node or device can act as a client or server and can communicate directly with other nodes without the need for a central server. This means that each node on the network can share and access resources such as files, printers, and bandwidth directly with other nodes on the network, rather than relying on a central server to manage these tasks.

## CJDNS (protocol)

CJDNS is a decentralized network protocol that allows for secure and private communication between nodes. It uses link-state routing and strong cryptography to protect the privacy and security of the network, as well as hash-based IP addresses that are difficult to censor or intercept. It was created as a secure and decentralized alternative to traditional network protocols like TCP/IP.

## What is it?

Hyperboria is a decentralized and distributed network that uses the cjdns protocol to offer a private and secure network. This network is not connected to the Internet and is primarily used for private communication and the exchange of information between trusted individuals and groups.

Hyperboria is considered part of the deepweb, as it is not accessible through traditional search engines and requires the use of special software to access it.
Currently Hyperboria has more than 400 nodes that have different contents of all types.

## Who created it?

Hyperboria was created by the cjdns project, led by a developer named Caleb James DeLisle. CJDNS is a decentralized network protocol that uses a combination of cryptography and hash-based IP addresses to allow for secure and private communication between nodes. Hyperboria is a network that uses the cjdns protocol and has been primarily developed by a community of volunteers and technology enthusiasts.

## Advantages and disadvantages

One of the main advantages of Hyperboria is the privacy and security it offers. As it is not connected to the Internet, it is less vulnerable to cyber attacks and surveillance by governments and companies. Additionally, by using the cjdns protocol, the network is very difficult to censor.

Another advantage of Hyperboria is its decentralized design, which means that the network is more resilient to outages and issues. However, one disadvantage of Hyperboria is that it is less user-friendly and has less available content than the Internet. It also requires the use of special software and a certain level of technical knowledge to set up and connect to the network. Additionally, the network is still relatively small and may not have as many users or resources as the Internet. Overall, Hyperboria is a useful tool for those who value privacy and security and are willing to trade off some convenience for it.
