# Introduction

The Tor network is an anonymity network that protects users' privacy when surfing the Internet. By hiding the user's location and identity, this network is useful for accessing websites blocked in certain locations and avoiding online censorship. Although it offers some security and privacy, it can also be slower than other browsing options and is not invulnerable to cyber attacks.

## Basics

## Tor network

The Tor network is an online anonymity network that is used to protect users' privacy when browsing the Internet. This network is especially useful for those who live in countries with online censorship or restrictions on access to certain websites.

## How does it work?

The Tor network works by sending Internet traffic through a series of servers (called nodes) around the world, making it difficult to trace a user's location or identity. By using the Tor network, users can access websites anonymously and prevent their online activity from being tracked.

## Advantages

One of the main advantages of the Tor network is the privacy it offers. By hiding the user's location and identity, the Tor network protects users' privacy when surfing the Internet. In addition, the Tor network is useful for accessing websites that might otherwise be blocked in a particular geographic location.

## Disadvantages

However, there are also some disadvantages to using the Tor network. One is that it can be slower than other browsing options because Internet traffic passes through several nodes rather than going directly to its destination. In addition, although the Tor network is secure, it is not invulnerable to cyber attacks and user privacy is not completely guaranteed.

## How to access?

The network is one of the easiest deepweb networks to use, this has made many people without knowledge about this network uninformed about it. To access you only need the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) which can be downloaded from the official website.

The tor browser is very easy to use, it has the same interface as [Firefox](https://mozilla.org)

## Conclusion

In summary, the Tor network is a useful tool for protecting users' privacy when browsing the Internet and accessing websites that are blocked in certain locations. However, there are also some disadvantages to using this network, such as a possible reduction in browsing speed and the possibility of vulnerability to cyber attacks.

Finally I will leave three links of three search engines that only filter by onion domains, this can be useful for beginners.
